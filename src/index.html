    <h1>VR:LAB - A interactive virtual reality web site for Google Cardboard and desktop</h1>
    <p>In 2015, the Danish virtual reality story telling company <a href="http://makropol.dk/">Makropol</a> gathered 18 Nordic artists and producers to create 9 point of view VR experiences. The project was called VR:LAB and the result was exhibited in Copenhagen.<p>
    <p>Makropol wanted to have a home page for VR:LAB that was built for virtual reality, and Immersion FTW developed a unique browser experience for them tailor-made to be viewed on the Google Cardboard.</p>
